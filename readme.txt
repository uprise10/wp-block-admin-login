Blocks every login attempt for the "admin" user, or every user, but the users in your install.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin blocks, by default, login attempts for the "admin" user. Because bots and hackers use automated login attempts on WordPress websites, specifically using the "admin" username, it's a good practice to never use this username. This plugin will block all login attempts that try to use this username.

### Features
* Block "admin" user only

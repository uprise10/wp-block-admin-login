# Block "admin" user for WordPress websites
This WordPress plugin blocks login attempts for the "admin" user. Since bots and hackers are just bruteforcing websites with using the "admin" user, it's just good practice to never use this login name. And to block these bots and hackers, you can use this plugin.

## Options
* Block "admin" user only
* Block every user, but the used users in your website.
* Choose the URL you want to blocked users to be redirected to. We will Rickroll them by default. Of course.
